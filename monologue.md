### Monologue


#### I. [Mobile computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_computing)
The term *Mobile Computing* was coined in the late 1990s. It gained popularity as a concept that focused on the ability to use computing devices while being mobile or on the move. This term encompasses a wide range of technologies and devices that enable users to access information, communicate, and perform tasks using portable devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and wearables. The rapid advancements in wireless communication technologies and the miniaturization of computing devices contributed to the rise of mobile computing as a significant field in the late 20th century. 

The impact is perceivable and substantial over decades. It greatly reshaped social behaviour and day-to-day life of everyone of us. Ideology changes further urges innovative and fanciful software and hardware products. 


#### II. [Distributed database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database)
This is a natural evolution to legacy monolithic database, general speaking all RDBMS. The concept of *distributed database* emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a response to the need for more scalable and resilient data storage solutions. With the growth of the internet and the need for global data access, distributed databases became increasingly important for managing data across different locations and enabling real-time access to information. 

The main advantage of having a central database is easy to maintain and closely align to [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) principle. However, in the light of mobile computing, it's impossible and impractical to have only one database serving requests from various locations. 

[Replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_(computing)) and [Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering) are brought to life. [CAP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) gives guideline on how to implement distributed database. 


#### III. Programming Paradigm 
Mobile computing gave birth to new application scenario. Everything we take it for granted nowadays, previously had to be done by sitting on chair before a computer at home or in the office in order to access to the internet. People span more time to interact with devices and thus demand for more applications. Among them, three challenges appears: 
- Mobile devices have limited computing power in terms of CPU, storage, RAM and power consumption; 
- Unstable or lost connection is a common issue, which would yield bad user experience; 
- Loyalty to product is low due to high level of competition. 
 
Connection management and user experience is the main arena in software. Other than that is hardware, which is the price and durability. All and all are contradictory factors. 

Modern languages support a diversified form of programming models dating from mainframe era, i.e. multi-processing, multi-tasking, multi-threading. But these are overpower or simply impractical in small devices. A single thread model such as Javascript seems more viable, callback and async/await makes everything possible in gadgets.

Who are the losers in the great game of mobile computing? IMHO, there is obviously two: 
- Intel in hardware;
- Microsoft in software;
